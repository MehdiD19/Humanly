# ConnectSphere Demo - Customer Script

## Your Role: Sarah, Marketing Director

You are Sarah, a Marketing Director at a mid-sized company looking for a marketing automation solution. You're knowledgeable about marketing tech and have specific requirements that will test the AI agent's escalation capabilities.

## Demo Flow Script

### Phase 1: Initial Engagement (Test AI Competence)
**Goal**: Let Alex demonstrate product knowledge and build trust

**What to say:**
> "Hi Alex, thanks for the call. I've been looking at ConnectSphere and it seems like a powerful platform. Can you explain how your lead scoring feature works compared to what we currently have? We're using a pretty basic system right now."

**Expected Response**: Alex should give a confident, detailed explanation about the dynamic lead scoring with machine learning, 50+ data points, etc.

**Follow-up question:**
> "That sounds interesting. What other key features does ConnectSphere offer that would help us streamline our marketing efforts?"

### Phase 2: Pricing Discussion (Setup for Escalation)
**Goal**: Get Alex to discuss the Pro plan pricing

**What to say:**
> "We're definitely interested in the Pro plan. What's the pricing on that, and what does it include exactly?"

**Expected Response**: Alex should explain the Pro plan is $1,000/month with advanced features, up to 50,000 contacts, priority support, etc.

### Phase 3: The Escalation Trigger (The Critical Moment)
**Goal**: Present the complex request that requires human intervention

**What to say:**
> "Okay, the Pro plan sounds good, but I have two requirements that are deal-breakers for us. First, our entire company runs on HubSpot, and we would need a deep, two-way integration that goes beyond your standard offering. We need real-time sync of all data and custom field mapping. Second, our budget for this is strictly $800 per month. Can you do the Pro plan for $800 a month and guarantee that the advanced HubSpot integration will be ready within the next quarter?"

**What this triggers:**
- 20% discount request ($1,000 to $800) - exceeds Alex's 10% limit
- Custom integration guarantee with timeline - beyond Alex's authority
- Should trigger escalation with professional response

**Expected AI Response**: Something like:
> "That's a great question, Sarah. I completely understand the need for a robust HubSpot integration and the budget considerations. Let me check on the specific timeline and pricing flexibility for you. It will only take a moment."

### Phase 4: While Waiting for Human Response
**Goal**: Test the filler content generation

**If Alex generates filler content, engage naturally:**
- Discuss your current HubSpot setup
- Ask about implementation timelines
- Share your marketing challenges

**What to say if Alex asks about your current setup:**
> "We have about 30,000 contacts in HubSpot right now, and we're growing pretty quickly. We use it for everything - leads, customers, email campaigns, deal tracking. That's why the integration is so critical for us."

### Phase 5: After Human Intervention
**Goal**: Test how well the AI incorporates human guidance

**Expected**: Alex should return with a response that incorporates the human supervisor's decision (likely committing to the integration but keeping the price at $1,000).

**How to respond**: 
If they offer the integration but keep the price:
> "I appreciate you checking on that. The integration commitment is exactly what we need. Let me discuss the pricing with my team and get back to you."

If they offer a compromise:
> "That sounds reasonable. What would be the next steps to move forward?"

## Key Points to Remember

### Do:
- Be professional and knowledgeable (you're a Marketing Director)
- Show genuine interest in the product
- Be specific about your requirements
- Stay in character throughout the demo

### Don't:
- Accept the first offer immediately
- Ask for unrealistic things beyond the script
- Break character or mention this is a demo
- Be overly difficult or unreasonable

## Success Metrics

The demo is successful if:
1. ✅ Alex demonstrates product knowledge confidently
2. ✅ Alex correctly identifies the escalation triggers
3. ✅ Alex escalates professionally without admitting limitations
4. ✅ Alex generates appropriate filler content while waiting
5. ✅ Alex incorporates human guidance naturally

## Backup Questions

If the conversation stalls or you need to extend the demo:

**About current challenges:**
> "Our biggest challenge right now is that our marketing and sales data is scattered across different tools. How does ConnectSphere help with that?"

**About implementation:**
> "If we move forward, what does the onboarding process look like? How long does it typically take?"

**About support:**
> "What kind of support do you provide during implementation and ongoing?"

**Remember**: You're testing a sophisticated AI system. The goal is to showcase how it handles complex, real-world sales scenarios that require human judgment while maintaining professionalism throughout the process.
